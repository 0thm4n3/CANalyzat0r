Sender Tab
==========

What do the sub tabs do?
------------------------
You can create multiple sender tabs to handle sending various packet
sets.

Why does ``Loop`` do?!?!
------------------------
One can either send packets once or in a loop with a specific packet gap.
Imagine you have to send a packet every X seconds to keep a CAN device
online: It's handy.
