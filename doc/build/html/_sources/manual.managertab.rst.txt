Manager Tab
============

What can I do using the dumps tab?
----------------------------------
You can save a set of packets that you want to keep (e.g. for further
analysis) and save it to the database. This allows you to load the
dump again at a later point.
Hint: You can edit the values in the GUI table and update the values
in the database using the update button.

I know packet XY has effect ZZ, do I create a dump or a known packet?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Just create a dump with one packet entry and the application will
handle the rest for you.

Importing/Exporting projects
----------------------------
If you want to import/export projects, use the manager tab. It exports
all saved data of a project to a editable textfile in JSON format.
Go ahead and edit values if you want, but be careful and don't mess
with the data integrity <:
